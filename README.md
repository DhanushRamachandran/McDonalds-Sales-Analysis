# üçî McDonald's Client Demo: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Leveraging Data-Driven Insights to Reverse Traffic Decline and Optimize Menu Promotions
# üìò Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project designed for McDonald's to diagnose and reverse declining customer traffic. The focus is on business intelligence around menu promotions, particularly the All Day Breakfast (ADB) initiative ‚Äî one of McDonald‚Äôs most impactful campaigns.

The project demonstrates how structured data analysis, statistical modeling, and strategic scenario planning can drive enterprise decision-making, optimize promotional impact, and support long-term business growth.

# üß≠ Objectives

The key goals of this analytical engagement were:

üîç Diagnose root causes of declining store traffic and revenue.

üí° Evaluate the effectiveness and ROI of the All Day Breakfast campaign.

üç≥ Identify high-leverage menu items and assess their elasticity.

üìà Recommend data-validated strategies to reverse negative traffic trends.

‚ôªÔ∏è Demonstrate a repeatable analytics framework for future pilot programs.


üß© Problem Statement

Over the past three years, McDonald's has faced a consistent decline in customer traffic, averaging a loss of 20,000 customers per store per year.
This trend directly impacts topline revenue, operational efficiency, and market share.

Key contributing factors examined:

üìâ Evolving customer preferences and demographic shifts

üçî Increased menu complexity leading to operational bottlenecks

üí¨ Ineffective or overly broad promotional campaigns

üßæ Inconsistent transaction and sales reporting practices

The project‚Äôs mission was to recalibrate promotional strategies‚Äîespecially All Day Breakfast‚Äîto act as sustainable growth engines rather than one-time sales spikes


The tech stack used for analysis include:
Python-
  Data Cleaning 
  Data Visualization
  Multivariate numerical analysis
Power BI- Data Visualization, Custom metrics
  
  
# üìä Data Observations

The analysis covers multiple years of transactional and demographic data.
Key insights surfaced from the EDA include:

Focus Area	Key Findings
Promotional Impact	Clear post-launch jump in sales for breakfast items (notably McMuffins & Hashbrowns).
Sustainability	Uplift tapers after several months ‚Äî indicating need for continued innovation.
Price Sensitivity	Strong inverse relationship between price and units sold ‚Äî vital for promo tuning.
Reporting Consistency	Missing or inconsistent transaction periods highlight the need for improved data pipelines.
Seasonal Trends	Cyclical patterns in breakfast sales inform optimal promo timing windows.

# EDA serves as the methodological backbone of this project.

Core Analytical Components

Data Cleaning & Validation

Ensured all transactional data from McD Restaurant Facts.csv and McD Weekly Sales.csv was well-structured, non-redundant, and validated.

Addressed missing weeks, incorrect types, and duplicate entries.

Revenue Attribution Models

Mapped uplift across menu items and time periods to isolate the impact of promotions.

Segmented contributions by item category and region.

Price vs. Units Regression

Quantified elasticity using regression analysis.

Visualized price‚Äìsales tradeoffs with scatterplots and confidence intervals.

Demographic Correlation

Integrated census and location data to evaluate promo responsiveness by region.

Identified high-ROI store clusters by median income, population growth, and traffic elasticity.

Promotion Causality (A/B Testing Framework)

Designed control-test group simulations to isolate promo effects from seasonality or macroeconomic shifts.

 Observation: The Transactions for the top All Day 
Breakfast items shows a clear sustained jump beginning 
around EO‚ÄôQ3 - EO‚ÄôQ4 2015, coinciding with the 
promotion launch.
 
Insight: The promotion has successfully 
lifted the volume baseline of our top 
breakfast items. The task is now to 
optimize which items and how to keep 
this growth engine running.

After the Promotion (Sept-Oct 2015) there was a buzz-period until Jan 2015 for 3-4 months and then 
1. the average sales has seen a jump as marked in the graph.
2. The combined Units sold has increased per month after the promotion by 25%

Customer Traffic (agc) - this approach focuses promotion power on the most elastic items which is the 
most effective lever for increase the primary goal: Avg daily customer transactions

Potential Approach: Focus on McMuffins for Traffic Growth
 1. Continue All Day Breakfast, offering only the McMuffin sandwich & Hashbrowns.
 2. All-Day Breakfast boosted McMuffin sales while lunch items remained stable.





üßÆ Strategy Options

Three distinct strategies were developed and evaluated for McDonald‚Äôs leadership teams:
| Strategy       | Description                         | Pros                                   | Cons                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach A** | Limit ADB to McMuffins & Hashbrowns | Streamlined operations, high ROI       | May miss niche breakfast demand              |
| **Approach B** | Remove ADB entirely                 | Simplifies menu and reduces complexity | Risks alienating breakfast loyalists         |
| **Approach C** | Expand ADB to additional items      | Broad appeal, increases traffic        | Raises operational costs and menu complexity |

Each approach includes:
Cost-benefit analysis
Projected traffic impact models
Operational complexity scores
Sensitivity testing outcomes


‚úÖ Recommendations

After analyzing multiple scenarios and model results, the following data-driven recommendations were formulated:

 Focus Promotion
Retain only McMuffin and Hashbrown in ADB offerings ‚Äî maximum uplift, minimal complexity.

 Geotargeting Promotions
Use app-based location data to push bundle promotions to mid-to-high-income growth neighborhoods.

 Controlled AB Testing
Introduce control groups to rigorously measure true promotional effects.

 Menu Simplification
Streamline menus during peak hours to reduce service bottlenecks and wait times.

 Integrated Marketing
Sync digital marketing (social, app, loyalty) with in-store signage for unified engagement.
